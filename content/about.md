**Warren Low**: I’m Warren, and I’m excited to be part of the AI Society’s executive committee. I’m a TIL Finalist from the DSTA competition and have gained valuable experience through two internships focused on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and AI agents. My journey in AI has involved learning about fine-tuning and working on some innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology. I’m looking forward to leveraging my background and collaborating with you all to drive impactful AI initiatives and make our society a hub of cutting-edge advancements. @bonyydinosaur, where I am starting a blog on AI papers.

**Vangmay Sachan**: I’m delighted to be part of the AI Society’s committee. I’m an AI enthusiast and an aspiring researcher in the field. In my most recent project, I conducted research on using LLMs for the field of relation extraction and wrote a literature survey. I love to learn new things and work on projects that push me out of my comfort zone. During freetime, you might find me reading philosophy, bouldering, playing badminton or just chilling having some tea.
